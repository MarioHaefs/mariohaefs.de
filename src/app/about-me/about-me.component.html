                    In 2022, I stumbled upon a coding tutorial on YouTube by chance. Out of curiosity, I reprogrammed it
                    and quickly realized that coding brought me great joy. After reprogramming several tutorials, I
                    began to seriously consider learning to code professionally. Surprisingly, the programmer from whom
                    I had reprogrammed the tutorials was actually offering training for career changers to become
                    professional programmers. After a few months of consideration, I decided to make the career change.

                    In January 2023, I started an online coding bootcamp at the Developer Akademie, a professional
                    coding school based in Munich. It has been an incredible journey filled with challenges, learning,
                    and growth. Now, I am looking forward to starting my career in the IT industry!
