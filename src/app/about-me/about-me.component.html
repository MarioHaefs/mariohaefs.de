                I'm a front-end developer from MÃ¶nchengladbach, Germany, with hands-on experience in crafting web apps
                using JavaScript and Angular. From a young age, I've been drawn to the world of computers, whether it
                was playing games, modding them, or assembling hardware components. This passion for technology
                reinforced my desire to work as a front-end developer.

                    In 2022, I stumbled upon a coding tutorial on YouTube by chance. Out of curiosity, I reprogrammed it
                    and quickly realized that coding brought me great joy. After reprogramming several tutorials, I
                    began to seriously consider learning to code professionally. Surprisingly, the programmer from whom
                    I had reprogrammed the tutorials was actually offering training for career changers to become
                    professional programmers. After a few months of consideration, I decided to make the career change.

                    In January 2023, I started an online coding bootcamp at the Developer Akademie, a professional
                    coding school based in Munich. It has been an incredible journey filled with challenges, learning,
                    and growth. Now, I am looking forward to starting my career in the IT industry!
