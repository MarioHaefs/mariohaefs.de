                    In 2022, I came across a coding tutorial on YouTube by chance, which I reprogrammed out of
                    curiosity. I enjoyed it a lot and after reprogramming a few more tutorials, I thought about learning
                    to code professionally. Surprisingly, the programmer from whom I reprogrammed the tutorials is
                    actually training career changers to become professional programmers. After thinking about the
                    career change for a few months, I decided to take the step.

                    In January 2023, I finally started an online coding bootcamp at the
                    Developer Akademie, a professional coding school based in Munich. It has been an incredible journey
                    filled with challenges, learning, and growth. Now, I am looking forward to starting my
                    career in IT!
